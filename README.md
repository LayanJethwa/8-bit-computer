This is an 8-bit computer I am building using the components in Ben Eater's kit, and his instructional series of YouTube videos.


## Features (so far)

- Bistable clock, switching between astable and monostable using 555 ICs
- Astable clock has variable frequency using a potentiometer
- 8-bit register with 8-bit data bus
